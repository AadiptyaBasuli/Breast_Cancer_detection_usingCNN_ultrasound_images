# Breast_Cancer_detection_usingCNN_ultrasound_images
The detection of breast cancer is critical for ensuring timely and appropriate medical intervention, leading to improved outcomes, better quality of life, and reduced societal and economic burdens associated with advanced cancer stages.
Regular breast cancer screenings and awareness are essential components of public health initiatives to combat this disease.
A CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, is a type of artificial neural network designed for tasks such as image recognition and classification. CNNs are particularly powerful for processing grid-like data, such as images and video frames. They have been highly successful in various computer vision tasks and are widely used in applications like image and video recognition, object detection, and facial recognition.
Here publicly available dataset on breast ultrasound images has been used.
